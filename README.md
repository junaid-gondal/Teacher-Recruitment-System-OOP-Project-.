 Teacher Recruitment System (OOP Project)

A **menu-driven Teacher Recruitment System** built as part of our **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) semester project**.
This application demonstrates core OOP concepts such as **classes, inheritance, polymorphism, file handling, and modular design** while solving a practical problem: managing and streamlining teacher recruitment tasks.

## 📌 Features

* Menu-based console interface for smooth navigation
* Add, update, search, and delete teacher records
* Manage applicant details using file handling for persistence
* Demonstrates core OOP principles:

  * **Encapsulation** of data through classes
  * **Inheritance & polymorphism** for structured design
  * **Abstraction** in separating logic and interface
* User-friendly and extendable codebase for future enhancements
